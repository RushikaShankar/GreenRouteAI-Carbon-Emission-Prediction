# GreenRouteAI-Carbon-Emission-Prediction
## GreenRouteAI: 
Carbon Footprint Optimization in Supply Chain Logistics.
A deep learning-based solution to predict and minimize carbon emissions in delivery route planning.

## Project Overview
Traditional logistics systems prioritize cost and time, often neglecting the environmental impact.
GreenRouteAI introduces a data-driven, AI-powered approach to optimize delivery routes with the goal of minimizing CO₂ emissions, empowering companies to make greener logistics decisions.

## Features
🚚 Predicts carbon emissions based on route distance, vehicle type, cargo weight, traffic, and weather

🌦 Integrates simulated or real-time traffic and weather data

🧠 Deep learning regression model built using TensorFlow

📊 Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

🔍 Route Suggestion Engine to rank delivery paths by predicted emissions

## Tech Stack
Language: Python

ML Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Visualization: Matplotlib

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment Ready: Compatible with Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI

Notebook: [Kaggle/Jupyter compatible]

## How It Works⚙️
1. Data Collection

   Simulated or real data from fleet GPS, weather APIs, map services

2. Preprocessing

   Encoding categorical variables (weather, traffic, vehicle type)

   Normalization of continuous features

   Feature engineering: emission per ton-km, speed, etc.

3. Model Training
   
   Supervised learning with a DNN regression model to predict carbon emissions

4. Evaluation

   Uses MAE, RMSE, and % error for performance tracking

5. Route Suggestion
   
   Compares emission predictions across candidate routes

   Ranks routes by lowest predicted CO₂ emissions
   
## Future Enhancements
🔁 Real-time route updates via Google Maps API

📍 Map visualization of routes

🎯 Reinforcement learning for dynamic routing

📈 Emission reports per vehicle or route
